%Strongly recommended
 %put your figures in one place
 
%you'll want these for pretty captioning
\usepackage[small]{caption}

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.8\textwidth} %make the figs 50 perc textwidth

% manual for caption http://www.dd.chalmers.se/latex/Docs/PDF/caption.pdf

%Optional: I like to muck with my margins and spacing in ways that LaTeX frowns on
%Here's how to do that
 \topmargin -2cm     
 \oddsidemargin -0.04cm   
 \evensidemargin -0.04cm  % same as oddsidemargin but for left-hand pages
 \textwidth 16.59cm
 \textheight 22.94cm 
 %\pagestyle{empty}       % Uncomment if don't want page numbers
 \parskip 7.2pt           % sets spacing between paragraphs
 %\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.5} 	% Uncomment for 1.5 spacing between lines
\parindent 0pt% sets leading space for paragraphs
\usepackage{setspace}
%\doublespacing

%Optional: I like fancy headers

\caption{Summary of linear models for relationships between later phenophases and earlier phenophases, as shown in Figure 3 in the main text. Two types of linear models were fit: those with the intercept only estimated and a forced slope of one, and those with both the slope and intercept estimated (i.e. s standard regression model). All models were fit with the species-level mean day-of-year of the later phenological stages as the response variable, and mean day-of-year of earlier phenostage as the explanatory variable.}

  \caption{\textbf{Individual tree phenology during the 2015 growing season, ordered by species-level mean first-flower dates.} Growth phenology is shown for budburst (from its mean start day-of-year to the mean start day-of-year for leafout, across all individuals within a species), leafout (from the mean day-of-year when fully-expanded leaves were first observed through the start of senescence), and senescence (from the mean day-of-year when leaves first began changing color through the mean day-of-year when more than 95 percent of leaves on the tree had changed color). Reproductive phenology is shown for flowering (from the mean day-of-year when flowers first appeared to the mean day-of-year when fruits first appeared, across all individuals within a species) and fruiting (from the mean day-of-year when fruits first appeared to the mean day-of-year when more than 95 percent of fruits were first observed as ripe).}
