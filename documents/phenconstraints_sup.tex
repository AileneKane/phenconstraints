%Here's how to do that
 \topmargin -2cm     
 \oddsidemargin -0.04cm

 \textwidth 16.59cm
 \textheight 22.94cm 
 %\pagestyle{empty}       % Uncomment if don't want page numbers
 \parskip 7.2pt           % sets spacing between paragraphs
 %\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.5} 	% Uncomment for 1.5 spacing between lines
\parindent 0pt% sets leading space for paragraphs

\caption{Summary of linear models for relationships between later phenophases and earlier phenophases, as shown in Figure 3 in the main text. Two types of linear models were fit: those with the intercept only estimated and a forced slope of one, and those with both the slope and intercept estimated (i.e., a standard regression model). All models were fit with the species-level mean day-of-year of the later phenological stages as the response variable, and mean day-of-year of earlier phenostage as the explanatory variable. Asterisks in Figure 3 correspond to models with r\textsuperscript{2} >0.10.}

\caption{Summary of linear models for relationships between later phenophases and interphase duration, as shown in Figure 4 in the main text. Linear models were fit with the species-level mean day-of-year of the later phenological stages as the response variable, and the number of days in each previous interphase duration as the explanatory variable. The random.slopes column gives the range in which 95 percent of slopes in the randomization occur (betwen 2.5 percent and 97.5 percent). Asterisks in Figure 4 correspond to interphase models with r\textsuperscript{2} >0.10.}

  \caption{\textbf{Individual tree phenology during the 2015 growing season, ordered by species-level mean first-flower dates.} Growth phenology is shown for budburst (from day-of-year it was first observed on the individual to the first day-of-year  leafoutwas observed), leafout (from the first day-of-year when fully-expanded leaves were observed through the first day senescence was observed), and senescence (from first day-of-year when leaves began changing color through the day-of-year when more than 95\% of leaves on the tree had changed color). Reproductive phenology is shown for flowering (from the first day-of-year when flowers appeared to the day-of-year when fruits first appeared, across all individuals within a species) and fruiting (from the first day-of-year when fruits appeared to the day-of-year when more than 95\% of fruits were first observed as ripe).}
