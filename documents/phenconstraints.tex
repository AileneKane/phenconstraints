\section* {Goal}
\par We aim to test the extent to which previous phenological stages constrain later ones, as this is poorly understood. We plan to submit this paper as a ``brief communication" at	American Journal of Botany ("Brief Communicationsâ€”Brief Communications are short (c 3000-5000 word) research articles reporting exciting, significant new findings. They include no more than 4 figures and tables, combined. Manuscripts, and their abstracts, should be organized as described for Research articles.") or a ``rapid report" at
New Phytologist.

\subsection* {Hypotheses}
 %\citep{wolkovich2014}
\par Hypothesis 1: Previous phenological events constrain later events; e.g., late-fruiting species set fruit late in the season because they leaf-out late  (Figure \ref{fig:hyp}).
\par Hypothesis 2: Inter-phenophase time  constrains phenology; e.g., late-fruiting species set fruit late in the season because they require longer development time (Figure \ref{fig:hyp}).
\section* {Materials and Methods}
\subsection*{Study site and focal species}
This study was conducted at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, a 281-acre park in Boston, Massachusetts, established in 1872. It contains a living collection of trees, shrubs, and vines that are native to New England, as well as others from around the world. Arboreta are great resources for studies across many species, particularly in temperate areas, since they may contain a higher diversity of tree species in one location than nearby natural areas. In addition, there is often high variation in phenology in the selection of species planted in arboreta for public enjoyment. For this study, I selected 25 focal angiosperm species with varying flowering times during the growing season (Table 1). I selected up to five individuals of each species for the study, yielding a total of 118 individuals in this study.

\subsection*{Phenology data collection}

\subsection*{Statistical analyses}
To understand the extent to which previous phenological events constrain later events (hypothesis 1), we fit linear models with each phenological stage that we observed (except budburst, the earliest stage we quantified) as the response variable (i.e. species-level mean day of year of leaf-out, flowering, fruiting, or senesence).  We fit 10 different models, each with one of the previous phenological stages as the explanatory variable. R\textsuperscript{2} and \textit{p}-value for each model are shown, with solid lines representing model fit when \textit{p}<0.05 and dashed lines representing model fit when 0.05<\textit{p}<0.10. Full model results are summarized in Table 1.
\section* {Results}
Main messages for Sally's thesis paper
\begin{enumerate}
\item Earlier phenological stages constrain later phenology (Figures \ref{fig:focsp}, \ref{fig:latevearly}). The strongest correlations occurred between adjacent stages (e.g. leaf-out and budburst, fruiting and flowering). Senescence was the only phenological stage not well-correlated with an earlier phanological stage.
\item Inter-phenophase duration constrains reproductive phenology (flowering and fruiting time, Figure \ref{fig:inter}). Furthermore, reproductive phenology appears to be constrained by both earlier inter-phenophase times (e.g. time between flowering and budburst, time between fruiting and flowering) and later interphase times (e.g. time between senescence and flowering). However, growth phenology was not strongly constrained.

\end{enumerate}
\section* {Discussion}
These stages support hypothesis 1, these support hypothesis 2, these are intermediate
Fruiting takes about 0-20 days for most species
Expect correlations could be strongest  at biggest at end of season. Geometric constraint.
\section* {Conclusions}
Next steps: Encourage a phylogenetic approach, collect data across years. We observed variation at whole organism level- may want to explore at individual flower/fruit level.

We expected the same patterns for other consecutive events,such as leaf bud-burst and leaf-out.
