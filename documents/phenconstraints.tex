\section* {Goal}
\par We aim to test the extent to which previous phenological stages constrain later ones, as this is poorly understood. We plan to submit this paper as a ``brief communication" at	American Journal of Botany or a ``rapid report" at
New Phytologist.

\section* {Hypotheses}
 %\citep{wolkovich2014}
\par Hypothesis 1: Previous phenological events constrain later events; e.g., late-fruiting species et fruit late in the season because they leaf-out late  (Figure \ref{fig:hyp}).
\par Hypothesis 2: Inter-phenophase time  constrains phenology; e.g., late-fruiting species set fruit late in the season because they require longer development time (Figure \ref{fig:hyp}).

\section* {Main Messages}
Main messages for Sally's thesis paper
\begin{enumerate}
\item Earlier phenological stages constrain later phenology (Figures \ref{fig:focsp}, \ref{fig:latevearly}). The strongest correlations occurred between adjacent stages (e.g. leafout and budburst, fruiting and flowering). Senescence was the only phenological stage not well-correlated with an earlier phanological stage.
\item Inter-phenophase time constrains reproductive phenology (flowering and fruiting time, Figure \ref{fig:inter}). Furthmore, reprudctive phenology appears to be constrained by both earlier inter-phenophase times (e.g. time between flowering and budburst, time between fruiting and flowering) and later interphase times (e.g. time between senescence and flowering). However, growth phenology was not strongly constrained.

\end{enumerate}
