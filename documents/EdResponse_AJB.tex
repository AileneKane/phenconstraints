\opening{Dear Editors:}
Thank you for tentatively accepting our paper, entitled ``Phenological sequences: how early-season events define those that follow,"  (ELE-01149-2017) for publication as a ``Brief Communication" in the \emph{American Journal of Botany.} 

We have made the changes suggested by the editor. These changes are described in the attached summary.

Thank you very much for the time and consideration you have given to our paper!

Sincerely,\\

\title{Response to Reviewers}
 \emph{Reviewer Comments are in italics.} Author responses are in plain text.

\par \emph{ASSOCIATE EDITOR COMMENTS}
\par \emph{The authors have done a very nice job of responding to the comments of the reviewers, including the addition of sections  suggesting additional research that could advance this general area of investigation.  I have no other comments to add, other than a few minor points.}
\par Thank you!
\par \emph  {In the references at line 358, Polygonum viviparum should be italicized and Polygonum should be capitalized.}
\par We have made the suggested changes.   

\par \emph{In the discussion, a number of sentences start with phrases such as ``Because of this,``This suggests," ``This could be due to.., "  all phrases that could be replaced with more straightforward declarative sentences.}
\par Thank you for calling attention to these phrases; we have removed the listed phrases and reworded the sentences, attempting to make them more straightforward. 

\par \emph{EDITORIAL OFFICE COMMENTS}

\par \emph{!For the final version of the manuscript please upload your article file in an editable format, preferably MS Word (.doc), and not as a PDF.}

\par \emph{Please remove the statistics from the abstract.}
\par We have removed all r-squared values previously contained in the abstract.

\par \emph{Key words can greatly enhance the discovery of your article. Please review your key words and consider whether they will help the reader find your work, i.e., by using words and phrases that are not already in the title or the abstract and/or including words that will widen the search-window of topics in your manuscript. For more details see ?c. Key Words? at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15372197/homepage/ForAuthors.html#ps} 
\par We have reviewed the key words and modified them slightly. The key words now are: angiosperm, arboretum, climate change, global warming, phenology curve, phenological mismatch, plant phenology, tree 
\par \emph{L101 - please add the lat/long for the arboretum.}
\par We have added the lat/long for the arboretum to this section, which now says: ``This study was conducted at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University (42.3074 \degree N, 71.1208\degree W), a 281-acre park in Boston, Massachusetts, established in 1872."

\par \emph{In the Literature Cited:}
\par \emph{a. replace the dashes that represent authors' names with their names written out in full.}

\par \emph{b. for multi-authored works, list the first seven authors and then ``et al." If there are only eight authors, then list all eight.}

\par \emph{Please delete the figures from the manuscript text (article file).  However, do keep the figure legends in the article file, listing them after the table.}  
\par We have made the requested change.

\par \emph{For the online supplements:}
\par \emph{a. Please name them Appendix S1, S2, etc., in the order in which they are referred to in the ms text regardless of whether they are figures or tables. } 
\par \emph{b. In the manuscript, after the first mention of the first online appendix, include the following: ``Appendix S1 (see the Supplementary Data with this article)." Please be sure that each appendix is referred to somewhere in the ms text.}
\par \emph{c. Upload each file separately.}  
\par \emph{d. On each file, place a header at the top of the page, using this format: ``Smith et al.American Journal of Botany 2018 Appendix S1"}.
\par \emph{e. On each file, also include a title/legend, prefaced by, e.g., ``Appendix S1" (we prefer the title to be on the file itself, but if necessary, for any given appendix its title can be placed after the figure legends instead. However, please do NOT provide a duplicate copy of any of the titles in a separate list as this adds confusion during the copyediting stage.)}
